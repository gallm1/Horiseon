# <01-HTML-Git-CSS Horiseon Homework>
## Description
This project is for homework assignment #1 which involved refactoring HTML and CSS for a Horieseon Social Solution Services, Inc. website.

A Git hub repository has been created and cloned to my desktop.  Once the homework is finalized, I will push the repository back to Git hub, copy the link to the repository and the website and submit my homework.
